# KOReader Sync XPath Mapping

This note documents how CrossPoint maps reading positions to and from KOReader sync payloads.

## Problem

CrossPoint internally stores position as:

- `spineIndex` (chapter index)
- `pageNumber` + `totalPages`

KOReader sync payload stores:

- `progress` (XPath-like location)
- `percentage` (overall progress)

A direct 1:1 mapping is not guaranteed because page layout differs between engines/devices.

## Current Strategy

### CrossPoint -> KOReader

Implemented in `ProgressMapper::toKOReader`.

1. Compute overall `percentage` from chapter/page.
2. Attempt to compute a real element-level XPath via `ChapterXPathIndexer::findXPathForProgress`.
3. If XPath extraction fails, fallback to synthetic chapter path:
   - `/body/DocFragment[N]/body`

### KOReader -> CrossPoint

Implemented in `ProgressMapper::toCrossPoint`.

1. Attempt to parse `DocFragment[N]` from incoming XPath.
2. If valid, attempt XPath-to-offset mapping via `ChapterXPathIndexer::findProgressForXPath`.
3. Convert resolved intra-spine progress to page estimate.
4. If XPath path is invalid/unresolvable, fallback to percentage-based chapter/page estimation.

## ChapterXPathIndexer Design

The module reparses **one spine XHTML** on demand using Expat and builds temporary anchors:

- anchor: `<xpath, textOffset>`
- `textOffset` counts non-whitespace bytes

Matching for reverse lookup:

1. exact path match
2. index-insensitive path match (`div[2]` vs `div[3]` tolerated)
3. ancestor fallback

If no match is found, caller must fallback to percentage.

## Memory / Safety Constraints (ESP32-C3)

The implementation intentionally avoids full DOM storage.

- Parse one chapter only.
- Keep anchors in transient vectors only for duration of call.
- Free XML parser and chapter byte buffer on all success/failure paths.
- No persistent cache structures are introduced by this module.

## Known Limitations

- Page number on reverse mapping is still an estimate (renderer differences).
- Image-only/low-text chapters may yield coarse anchors.
- Extremely malformed XHTML can force fallback behavior.

## Operational Logging

`ProgressMapper` logs mapping source in reverse direction:

- `xpath` when XPath mapping path was used
- `percentage` when fallback path was used

It also logs exactness (`exact=yes/no`) for XPath matches.

## Validation

Use test vectors in:

- `test/koreader_sync/roundtrip_vectors.md`
- `test/koreader_sync/memory_resource_qa.md`
